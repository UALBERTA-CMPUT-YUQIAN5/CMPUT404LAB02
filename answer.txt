1. We use SOCK_STREAM when creating the sock. We use SOCK_DGRAM to create UDP sockets.

2. The client socket is active trying to make connection to other sockets whereas the server sockets will only be listening for connections.

3. We use the SO_REUSEPORT or SO_REUSEADDR option when setting socket option

4. We get to know their address family (AF_INET/AF_INET6), socket type (TCP/UDP), server address, server port, client address, client port and proto.

5. After server side closing the TCP socket, recv will return empty string indicate that the connection is closed.
